# Mr Bhrama - The AI Tutor Bot

I trust you're all enjoying the influx of exciting technologies. I'm thrilled to unveil the result of a recent hackathon endeavor â€“ a project I developed in just around 7-8 hours. This creation synergizes the capabilities of generative AI with the realm of education.

It's a bot using GPT-4 model, integrated with Phoenix (Elixir language based framework) backed by PostgreSQL. It is tailored to assist high-school students, from grade levels 1 to 12, as well as those pursuing engineering degrees, its all the game of setting the right depth using simplest prompt engineering patterns.

## Demo

The system can be run locally or deployed on https://fly.io by following the instructions in the README.md. The endpoint, `/chat/:ANY_USER_NAME:?class=[:DEPTH:]`, accommodates a range of interactions, covering classes from 1 to 12, as well as academic levels like "undergraduate," "graduate," and beyond. It retains the context of the user's identity and their current educational focus, ensuring alignment with their age or curriculum level.

## Running Locally

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `docker compose up -d` in deamon mode for booting up PostGres DB
  * Get your OPEN-AI Key, remember to use the GPT-4 version
  * `export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY"` - Should be GPT-4 based for optimal response.
  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/chat/john?class=4`](localhost:4000/chat/john?class=4) from your browser.
